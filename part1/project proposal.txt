3. project description:
The goal of this project aims at analyzing the relationship between government measures and the spread of the virus (confirmed and/or mortality cases) over time.

Tentative approaches:
Firstly, we would like to visualize and possibly quantize to examine how aggressively government measures are implemented in response to covid-19 (i.e.: timeline) across different countries. 
Then, we would corroborate the timeline of government measures with the timeline of virus spread in each of these countries.
Finally, we would attempt to adopt different analysis methods, e.g., regression, classification, etc. to mine the potential connections between government measures and the virus spread.

By analyzing dates of when government measures are implemented for different countries, we aim to answer the following questions:
1. How effective at reducing virus spread are each of the government measures taken?
2. Which governments responded the fastest, most frequently and are there correlations between spread and response time?
3. What kind of goverment measures are the most effective at reducing virus spread?

Bigger questions we hope to answer through our analysis include:
1. How much (quantitation) of a reduction in spread and mortality is there if a government took measure X or implemented the measure at time Y instead?
2. What the virus spread will be in the future (prediction) by taking consideration of the currently implemented government measures?
